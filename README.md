Slice-and-Dice
==============
Treemaps display hierarchical (tree-structured) data as a set of nested rectangles.
Each branch of the tree is given a rectangle, which is then tiled with smaller rectangles 
representing sub-branches.  A leaf node's rectangle has an area proportional to a specified 
dimension on the data.
